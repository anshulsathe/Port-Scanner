# Port-Scanner
Steps for scanning an IP for open ports using nmap library in python:

1. Select begin and end port
2. Set target IP which will be your attacker's IP
3. Run the code.

Outcome:

This code will give you the details of all the ports in the [begin, end] range. It will display which ports are open and which are closed.
Status of ports can be used further by the attacker to gain access or escalate existing privilege.
